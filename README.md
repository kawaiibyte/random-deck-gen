# random deck generator
i didn't like that clash royales randomized deck builder wasn't true random, so thats why this exists

# how to use
1. clone or download the repo (duh)
2. open a terminal where the repo is and run `node main.js`
3. thats it, even an idiot could run this

# note
im not going to add heroes or future evos since i dont care about playing cr anymore 💀
